# OSMA-Representation-Repository
This is the OSMA Representation Repository

-------

The OSMA is the Open Source Museum of Abandonment created at Unidee @ Citt√† dell'Arte (Fondazione Michelangelo Pistoletto) during the Ubiquitous Infoscapes workshop, in May 2015.

It represents the first instance of a model for an Open Source Museum, in which ubiquitous forms of data, information, knowledge and expressions can be captured, archived and represented.

It is a completely Open Source Museum, which can be extended, trasformed, adopted by other people, organizations, associations, administrations, artists, designers and more.

It includes:

- a Digital Toolkit for capturing ubiquitous forms of data / information / knowledge, and storing them in the archive

- a Physical / Hybrid Toolkit, to capture physical and hybrid forms of data / information / knowledge, and storing them in the archive

- an Open Source Archive format, which describes how the data / information / knowledge is stored in the archive, and which can be extended, expanded, modified

- a data / information / knowledge extraction toolkit, which allows to extract objects from the archive, and use them to create collections, artworks, performances, installations, publications, research, visualizations

- a representation repository, in which all new representations are stored and updated as they are produced, ready to be used in other open source museums, and to be extended, expanded and modified by people wishing to create novel representations, under the form of collections, artworks, performances, installations, publications, research, visualizations

The Open Source Museum model introduces multiple concepts which confront with major philosophical and practical issues such as representation and self-representation, documentation and preservation models in ine information era, cultural dissemination in the age of ubiquitous technologies, archival and preservation of digital, ubiquitous and hybrid experiences (such as performances, networked artworks, ubiquitous publications and more).

The Open Source Museum also introduces novel interpretations of widely adopted concepts, forming an innovative approach. For example the use of "HOW-TO" documentation as a possible and intriguing way in which to document and preserve performances, network enabled artworks and more.

This is a intended as a collaborative effort. We have produced what we consider to be an interesting first step. Everyone is invited to participate and extend the model and its implementations, to discuss on possible alternatives and interesting configurations, and to integrate and adopt the model worldwide.
